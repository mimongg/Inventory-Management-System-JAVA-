Welcome to My Inventory Management System!

I'm excited to share this basic Inventory Management System with you, built using JAVA (NetBeans) and FlatLaf. The interface is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy to manage your inventory.

Feel free to use this as a reference for your own projects or assignments. If you find it helpful, a shoutout in the credits would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you, and happy coding!
